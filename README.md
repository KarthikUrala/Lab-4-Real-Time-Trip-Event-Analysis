# Lab-4-Real-Time-Trip-Event-Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project is part of **CST8917 Lab 4** and implements a **real-time taxi trip monitoring system** using **Azure Event Hub**, **Azure Function**, **Azure Logic Apps**, and **Microsoft Teams**.  

The solution:
- Ingests real-time taxi trip data via Event Hub  
- Analyzes incoming trips for unusual patterns  
- Sends rich **Adaptive Card alerts** to Microsoft Teams  
- Helps supervisors detect fraud, suspicious vendor activity, or group rides instantly

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **Components**
- **Azure Event Hub:** Captures simulated taxi trip events (`vendorID`, `tripDistance`, `passengerCount`, `paymentType`).
- **Azure Function:** Decodes Base64 events, analyzes for anomalies (`LongTrip`, `GroupRide`, `CashPayment`, `SuspiciousVendorActivity`).
- **Azure Logic App:** 
  - Triggered by Event Hub messages  
  - Sends data to Azure Function  
  - Loops through analyzed trips  
  - Posts Adaptive Cards to Microsoft Teams
- **Microsoft Teams:** Receives alerts for interesting or normal trips.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Event Hub
- Created namespace and Event Hub `trip-events`.
- Configured Shared Access Policies with Manage rights.
- Python script `send-events.py` sends simulated JSON trip events.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Function
- Function `analyze_trip` processes events:
  - Decodes Base64
  - Flags anomalies
  - Returns JSON summary.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Logic App
- Trigger: Event Hub (batch mode).
- HTTP action: Sends events to Azure Function.
- For Each loop: Iterates analyzed trips.
- Conditional routing:
  - üö® **Interesting trips** ‚Üí Adaptive Card.
  - ‚úÖ **Normal trips** ‚Üí No-issue card.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Suspicious vendor activity** ‚Üí Special alert.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Microsoft Teams
- Logic App posts Adaptive Cards to Teams channel `nothing` for real-time monitoring.

## üîë Azure Function Logic

### Detection Rules
- **Long Trip:** Distance > 10 miles  
- **Group Ride:** Passenger count > 4  
- **Cash Payment:** PaymentType = 2  
- **Suspicious Vendor Activity:** Cash payment and distance < 1

### Logic App Workflow

- Trigger: Event Hub (batch mode)
- HTTP Action: Sends events to Azure Function
- For Each: Iterates analyzed trips
- Condition: Checks isInteresting
- Teams Posting: Adaptive cards sent accordingly

### Lessons Learned

- Handling Base64 decoding for Event Hub messages is crucial
- Configuring consumer groups ensures no event loss
- Adaptive Cards improve visibility in Teams
- Real-time event-driven architecture reduces manual monitoring
